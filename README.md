## Clean Code Principles 
- Develop skills essential for deploying production machine learning models
- Coding best practices 
- Testing, Logging

### Project: predict Customer Churn with Clean Code
In this project, I will identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

This project will use the skills for testing, logging, and best coding practices. How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers who are likely to churn?

Below are the first few rows associated with the dataset for this project, which was pulled from Kaggle.
